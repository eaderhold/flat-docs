# `capitalize-first()`

```xml
string capitalize-first(string input)
```

Converts the first character of the string given in the `input` parameter
to upper case. If the first character is not a lower case character, `input`
is returned unmodified. Only the very first character of the entire input is
converted, not the first character of each word.
